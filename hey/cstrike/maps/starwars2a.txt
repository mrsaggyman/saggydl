Star Wars 2A - Fight to the Death
Map by [-THK-]G-Man

Each team has weapons to choose from within the
armory, as well as two pilotable Tie Fighters
in each spawn. When leaving spawn, be mindful 
of the laserbeams before exiting. Control panels
can be found next to the door, as well as in the
middle of the map, if you want to open the enemy's 
spawn door.
